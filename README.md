  GalapaLauncher
</h1>

GalapaLauncher is a simple, modern launcher for the Dragon Quest X MMORPG. It is built with Avalonia
and supported on Windows 10+ and Proton. It is designed to start quickly, use minimal resources, and
support multiple languages. It has the lofty goal to eventually provide replacements or automatic
management/installation for all support programs for DQX (Updater, Launcher, Config,
[Clarity][clarity], etc.) so that anyone can easily play DQX, anywhere, in any language.
